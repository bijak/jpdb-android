# jpdb-android
Unofficial community-built app for the Japanese language learning tool jpdb.io. 

While the web app works in most scenarios, the goal with making a native app to wrap the website is to
ensure that core features of the SRS like audio autoplay are working as intended since they are not
supported by every mobile browser.

### Known Issues
- Back gesture does not go back to the previous page in the website
- Clicking external links, or internal links not meant to go to web pages does not work as intended
- Status bar unreadable when not in night mode and using app
- "Use system default" doesn't follow Android's dark mode setting
